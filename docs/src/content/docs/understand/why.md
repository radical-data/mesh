title: Why Mesh?
description: The story, urgency, and imagination behind this project.
---

> When Palestine lost internet access, families couldn't message loved ones three blocks away.  
> That moment exposed a brutal truth: the networks we rely on are centralised, fragile, and governed by powers we can't control.

## 🧭 What is this project?

This project builds a self-organising, decentralised mesh network; one that doesn't rely on corporations, satellites, or even the internet.

It's a technical prototype.  
It's an art installation.  
It's a public provocation.

It asks:

> What if we could talk to each other _without permission_?

## 🔥 Why now?

- Because billionaires decide who gets Starlink in Ukraine.
- Because governments shut down the internet during protest.
- Because a single cable cut can isolate whole communities.

And yet, we've seen people find ways to resist:

- Protesters in Hong Kong using Bluetooth mesh apps
- Sneaker-net file sharing in Cuba
- Community mesh movements like Guifi, Freifunk, and NYC Mesh
- DIY satellite dishes, signal flags, even encrypted lasers

What they show is this:

> Communication _has never just been technical_. It has always been political, poetic, and profoundly human.

## 💡 What are we trying to show?

That networks don't have to be services we rent.  
They can be spaces we share.  
They can be run on local hardware, open tools, and collective care.

This isn't about going offline.  
It's about _reimagining online_, on our own terms.

## ✨ What does the installation do?

At the Public Spaces conference, we've built a working local mesh network inside the venue. It allows you to:

- Connect without internet
- Access services like Etherpad and file sharing
- Join a shared network that configures itself
- Understand how infrastructure actually works
- Imagine what digital public space could be

## 🌐 But it's not just local

This project draws from, and gestures toward, a global movement:

- **Guifi.net** in Catalonia: cooperative mesh with fibre links
- **Freifunk** in Germany: citywide civic wireless
- **NYC Mesh**: open, decentralised ISP alternative
- Mesh and local-first experiments in Latin America, South Africa, and beyond

This isn't design fiction.  
It's happening now, and it can happen here.

## 🧭 Our North Star

We want to:

- **Reclaim** the internet as a commons
- **Reimagine** infrastructure as public, not private
- **Reveal** the hidden politics of digital life

Not just to resist collapse, but to spark joy, imagination, and new forms of connection.

## 🛑 What this is _not_

- ❌ A nostalgic retreat into "offline"
- ❌ A complete, finished system
- ❌ A tool only for crisis

## ✅ What it _is_

- ✅ A functioning mesh you can join today
- ✅ A public, local-first network you can understand
- ✅ A fragment of a better future, built with what we have now

## 🕊 Final thoughts

> When a network is truly public, no one can switch it off.  
> Not a government. Not a company. Not even us.

This is an invitation.

To build something different.  
To share it.  
And to imagine what comes next.
